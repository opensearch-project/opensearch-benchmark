OpenSearch Benchmark is the macrobenchmarking framework for OpenSearch.

What is OpenSearch Benchmark?
-----------------------------

If you are looking to performance test OpenSearch, then OpenSearch Benchmark is for you. It can help you with the following tasks:

* Running performance benchmarks and recording results
* Setting up and tearing down OpenSearch clusters for benchmarking
* Managing benchmark data and specifications across OpenSearch versions
* Discovering performance problems by attaching so-called telemetry devices
* Comparing performance results
* Creating customized workloads

We have also put considerable effort into OpenSearch Benchmark to ensure that benchmarking data are reproducible.
