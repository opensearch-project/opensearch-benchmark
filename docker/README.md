# OpenSearch Benchmark Docker Image

This Docker image allows users to spin up a Docker container preloaded with essential dependencies and get started with OpenSearch Benchmark faster.

# Running the OpenSearch Benchmark Image
**Prerequisite:** Ensure that Docker is installed. If not, refer to [this guide to download Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [this guide to download Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

To run the image in a Docker container, invoke the following command:
```
docker run opensearchproject/opensearch-benchmark [OSB ARGS]
```

For instance, using `-h` for the arguments will print the OSB help information. Once the OSB process completes, the Docker container is automatically terminated.

To run in interactive mode, run `docker run --entrypoint bash -it opensearchproject/opensearch-benchmark -c /bin/sh`. This will place you into a shell to interact with the container where you can invoke opensearch-benchmark with any desired subcommands or options. When you are finished, exit from the shell to terminate the container.

### Minor Bug found in OSB 0.2.0 on Dockerhub and Pypi
For OSB version 0.2.0 on Dockerhub and Pypi, running opensearch-benchmark without any arguments will result in a failure. See the following for examples:

Ran opensearch-benchmark docker image with tag 0.2.0 without any args
```
$ docker run opensearchproject/opensearch-benchmark opensearch-benchmark
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opensearch-benchmark/venv/bin/opensearch-benchmark", line 8, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())
             ^^^^^^
  File "/opensearch-benchmark/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/osbenchmark/benchmark.py", line 949, in main
    console.init(quiet=args.quiet)
                       ^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'quiet'
```

Installed OSB Pypi version 0.2.0 and ran opensearch-benchmark without any args
```
$ opensearch-benchmark
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/ec2-user/.local/bin/opensearch-benchmark", line 8, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())
  File "/home/ec2-user/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/osbenchmark/benchmark.py", line 949, in main
    console.init(quiet=args.quiet)
AttributeError: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'quiet'
```
This has been resolved in [issue #237](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark/issues/237). This fix will be incorporated into versions after 0.2.0.

# Building a Copy of OpenSearch Benchmark Image
1. Git clone OpenSearch Benchmark Github repository
2. Make changes locally
3. Run `docker build -t <docker image name>:<optional tag> -f ./docker/Dockerfile .`

# Publishing a New Version of OpenSearch Benchmark Image
After updating [version.txt](../version.txt) with the newest major, minor, and patch version and before publishing a tag to the repository, ensure that [docker.yml](../.github/workflows/docker.yml) has the tags updated. The last tag in the list should be updated to the new major, minor, and patch version found in [version.txt](../version.txt).
```
tags: opensearchstaging/opensearch-benchmark:latest,opensearchstaging/opensearch-benchmark:<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH VERSION FROM VERSION.TXT>
```
